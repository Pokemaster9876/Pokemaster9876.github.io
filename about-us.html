<h1>About This Website</h1>

<h2><strong>Welcome to my first website</strong></h2>
<rfont>
<p><mark><rfont>This website was created for fun by a boy named Rani, Rani was a curious boy and wanted to make a website but did not want to pay for wix which charged you a fee for your website based on a subscribtion based plan. So Rani went off on a quest on his favorite website, Youtube. Thats were he found tinkernut who tuaght him the ways of HTML or hyper text markup language. Tinkernut was a good youtuber but 10 year old Rani did not find him interesting for he soon gave up his website making dreams because it was simply "too boring", so he gave up. 6th grade rolled around and they had a book fair at the shcool like they always did. But this one was different because they were selling a book called create with code which taught Rani the ways of code 2 years later Because he left the book sitting on his shelf for 2 years. But now he is back and ready to learn so he made this website not knowing its purpose but he knew he wanted it too be somewhat useful so here you are reading this text while Rani wishes he had the parts to build his gaming pc. Thank you for reading this long paragraph that was somewhat entertaining -Rani</mark></rfont></p>
